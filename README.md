# Welcome to my Portfolio

This is the codebase for my portfolio. It's built with React and Typescript, and hosted here on GitHub.

[Take a look at my Portfolio](https://dallasopelt.dev/)

## To-do
* Maybe - Change `<Social>` to accept a list or icon string.  
The list will return the container and list of icons, the string will return only the icon.
* Add additional pages for experience, projects, like an online resume


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
