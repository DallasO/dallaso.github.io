          Full stack Web Developer located in the greater Seattle area.

        <p>
          As a Web Developer, I've used many technologies to create beautiful frontends and featureful backends. I believe in mobile and UX first design.

        <p>
          Recently, I've focused on the frontend working directly with the marketing department to translate content into code for landing pages and emails. This included HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and jQuery, as well as working with multiple Content Management Systems to capture customer data or host my code. I even used jQuery to implement an autocomplete search box to allow users to search for a product. This search also supported fuzzy searching, so the user doesn't have to be exact with their query.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've also worked as a full stack web developer helping multiple clients of various size. I specialized in the XCart eCommerce software, which is powered by PHP. I would fix mobile issues, add features to the backend and additional functionality to the store front, and apply security patches to XCart.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm currently working on projects using technologies such as Python, Django, and React. One of my projects is working with a data set so I can analyze trends, and visualize the data with a charting framework.
